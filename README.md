# 🎧 THE — Audio Reactive Visualizer

[Live Demo](https://subsussp.github.io/THE)

**THE** is a WebGL-powered music visualizer that transforms audio tracks into dynamic, real-time visual experiences. Users can upload their own music, and the site will generate a unique audiovisual display using 3D graphics, shaders, and sound analysis.

## ✨ Features

- 🎵 **Audio Upload** — Upload local audio files (e.g., MP3, WAV)
- 🔊 **Real-Time Audio Analysis** — Uses Web Audio API to extract frequency & amplitude data
- 🌌 **3D Visual Effects** — Built with Three.js, custom shaders, and particle systems
- 🎨 **Customizable Scenes** — Visuals react to beat, bass, treble, and volume
- 🚀 **Optimized Performance** — Smooth animation loop with efficient rendering
- 💡 **Future Plans** — MIDI input, preset scenes, user controls, and mobile support
